# Task 7: Feedback

## ‚è≥ Time Taken
- **Total Duration:** `~16 hours`

## ‚úÖ What Worked Well
- Clear instructions
- The example from the scanner helped immensely
- No major debugging issues

## ‚ùå Challenges & Issues
- Initial set up was a bit more time consuming as I had to start a fresh environment on my windows computer
- Figuring out where and how to log to the console was a tad difficult
- Reintroducing myself to C++ in an OOP fashion was a tad difficult as C# is a bit more intuitive with inheritence 
- May be a bit more difficult for people with only MacOS as even in the README it states it only runs on windows. Would take a bit more time to set up a VM or container to run and test the modules. 


## üöÄ Suggestions for Improvement
- Some setup instructions would be helpful for the electron and vue setup
- Maybe a simple diagram of how the systems interact with one another for integration would be of help


## üìù Additional Comments
- This would have been a bit easier for me to do in C# as I am much more familiar but overall was not impossible to context switch back to C++ but there was a re learning curve
- Sorry I did not get to Task 6 before our interviews!
